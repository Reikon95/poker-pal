# PokerPal

PokerPal is a way to learn to play poker better by helping you understand outcomes.

Using it, you can:

- Learn the rules of the game
- Understand what hands to play, and when to do so
- Manage Risk
- Simulate Games
- Understand Game Theory

Poker is partially a game of luck, but the aim of this project is to give you an upper hand on your rivals by learning theory behind the glamour. Please note, this is an application is for LEARNING purposes only, it is not intended to be used as an in-game tool. There's a reason I am a software engineer living in a flat in South London and not a multimillionaire pro in Vegas ;)


# Technical Details

PokerPal is written in typescript and utilises Angular. Python is also planned for integration.

Only dependency atm is CardsJS for the svgs.
